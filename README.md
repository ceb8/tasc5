# Accessing TESS Data Programmatically: A MAST case study 

This repository contains the materials for my interactive software demo at the TASC5/KASC12 meeting.

## Abstract

The Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, home of the TESS science data, provides many tools to retrieve and interact with that data. Because of the size of the data set, one of the most powerful and flexible ways is to access the data programmatically. In this presentation I will give a brief overview of the available MAST interfaces followed by an example workflow that demonstrates the power of our programmatic access tools for a specific asteroseismology application.
